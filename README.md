# Microproject 1

This project is a basic Express.js application that serves a small website and loads JSON data from the server. 
The project includes a data folder with a JSON file, a public folder with the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, 
and an Express server file that handles routing and sending the JSON data to the browser. 
The website has three pages, and one page contains a button that fetches the JSON data using async and await. 
To run the project, install the required packages using npm install and then start the server using node app.js or nodemon app.js. 
After the server runs, open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to view the website. All required screenshots are included in the PDF file for submission.
